    <h3>Logo</h3>
    <p>I haven't think about one, but I am looking for something elegant and simple</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
    <p>I want my site to have simple colors, because the main idea is that the colors of the products
      highlight, so I'm thinking about these colors:
    </p>
    <img src="images/color.PNG" alt="light_steel_blue_gainsboro"/> 
    <img src="images/color2.PNG" alt="beau_blue"/>
    <img src="images/color3.PNG" alt="baby_powder"/>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>
      My header headings are going to have "Times New Roman" font and for my
      regular texts i still don't have a font, but I will look maybe for something basic as "Arial"
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>The first wireframe is from the Home Page of my site, I want it to be simple with attractive
      images and the navigation
    </p>
    <img src="images/home.PNG" alt="home_wireframe">
    <p>The second wireframe is where I will be showing some mkeup products, their name, brand, 
      and price in dollars, pesos, euros, and pounds</p>
      <img src="images/products.PNG" alt="products_wireframe">
    <p>
      The last wireframe is where I will be showing some discount codes, and products in discount
    </p>
    <img src="images/discount.PNG" alt="discounts_wireframes">
