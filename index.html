  <h1>Yamileth Rivero</h1>
  <p>Each <em>September 16th</em> mexicans celebrate the <strong>independence of Mexico</strong>, they cook typical dishes, listen and dance to traditional music, and dress according to their culture
  <br>Hi, I'm Yami and I'm mexican, celebrating the independence of Mexico is one of my favorite traditions, when I'm not celebrating or eating lots of mexican food I usually:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read (detective fiction books are my favorites)</li>
    <li>Practice makeup</li>
    <li>Watch documentaries (about animals)</li>
    <li>Eat lots of spicy chips and popcorns</li>
    <li>Listen to music</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Those are some of my favorite activities!</em></p>
